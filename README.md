### Brief Introduction:
<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr/>



<!-- Welcome to my Ecommerce Project Repository, a portfolio project of mine!

This project serves as a personal learning experience, allowing me to test my abilities in seeing a project through from start to finish. Rather than replicating existing stores, the focus is on developing robust business logic and integrating various technologies.

My goal was to fully immerse myself in building an ecommerce application, exploring different topics and honing my implementation and integration skills. While efficiency could have been prioritized, the main objective was to gain comprehensive knowledge. -->
<br><br><br/>











### Important points to note:
<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>



<!-- <li> The project places less emphasis on creating visually stunning designs. Instead, it prioritizes building and refining business logic, implementing functionality, and exploring diverse technologies.
<br><br>
<li> The user interface and design maintain a minimalistic and functional approach, allowing a greater focus on learning and development.
<br><br>
<li> This project doesn't aim to create a real store with actual products. Instead, the focus is on building business logic and refining development skills, simulating real-world scenarios and mirroring professional work environments.

<h1 align='center'> Development Journey</h1>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<br/>

In this section, I'll guide you through the step-by-step process of bringing this project to life. From initial concept to final implementation, I've documented my progress, highlighting the tools, technologies, and methodologies used along the way.

Please note that this project was primarily a learning experience. While there may have been more efficient approaches, I intentionally explored specific topics and tested my abilities with various technologies and libraries.

Join me on this behind-the-scenes adventure as I share exciting milestones, challenges, and valuable lessons learned as a solo developer. Experience the transformation of an idea into a fully functional ecommerce platform.

System Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Node.js 16.8 or later.
<li>macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
</ul>
<br>

First, Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
<br>

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
<br>

Third, Open up <code>localhost:3000</code> to view your application. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

<ul>
<li>You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
<li>[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
<li>The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
<li>This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
